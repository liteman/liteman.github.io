Since taking Joseph Opacki's ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josephopacki/)) malware reversing course in the [GMU Digital Forensics and Cyber Analysis](https://volgenau.gmu.edu/program/view/20560) program, and later [FOR610 @ SANS](https://www.sans.org/course/reverse-engineering-malware-malware-analysis-tools-techniques) with [Lenny Zeltser](https://twitter.com/lennyzeltser)  - I've been fascinated with malware analysis and reverse engineering. Unfortunately, in the years since those classes, I have not had much professional opportunity to use the skills directly.  

I have ~~finally~~ decided to take matters in to my own hands. I can get all the practice I need through efficient use of my home lab and library.

Hands-on keyboard, dissecting samples is where I want to be. So here is my plan.  
<!--excerpt-->  

At my disposal, I have a spiffy [System76](https://system76.com/laptops/oryx) laptop, VMWare Workstation Pro, a fantastic infosec community, and these awesome books:

- **Practical Reverse Engineering** [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Reverse-Engineering-Reversing-Obfuscation/dp/1118787315/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=9781118787311&qid=1572397110&sr=8-1)
- **Reversing: Secrets to Reverse Engineering** [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Reversing-Secrets-Engineering-Eldad-Eilam/dp/0764574817/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=9780764574818&qid=1572397285&sr=8-1)
- **Hacking: The Art of Exploitation** [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Hacking-Art-Exploitation-Jon-Erickson/dp/1593271441/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=9781593271442&qid=1572397337&sr=8-1)
- **Practical Malware Analysis** [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Malware-Analysis-Hands-Dissecting/dp/1593272901/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=9781593272906&qid=1572397386&sr=8-1)
- **Malware Analyst's Cookbook** [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Malware-Analysts-Cookbook-DVD-Techniques/dp/0470613033/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=9780470613030&qid=1572397426&sr=8-1)

I used to have a copy of **The Art of Memory Forensics** [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Memory-Forensics-Detecting-Malware/dp/1118825098/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=Memory+forensics&qid=1572578935&sr=8-3), but I think I lost it in a recent move. I may add that to the list here in a couple days -- we'll see.

I'll move through these books in parallel - covering all of the Chapter 1s before moving on, then all of the Chatper 2s and so on. I will attempt to document my journey.  

Here I go.
